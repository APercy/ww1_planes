Modpack to add WWI era planes to Minetest. The main goal of this modpack is to make the the possibility of dogfights over
Minetest skies and some bombing missions.
Fuel is needed to operate the planes, and ammuniotion to combat. The ammunition can be fed through plane inventory.
To shot bullets, just punch. To drop bombs, hold AUX (E key) and punch. The plane can be armed with 300 rounds of bullets
and more can be loaded from the plane inventory using the "Reload" button. The bombs don't need a reload, it will drop
directly from plane inventory. So choose wisely what you carry on plane's inventory.
